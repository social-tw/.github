# Welcome to Unirep Social TW contributing guideline üëãüèª
Thank you for investing your time in contributing to our project! 
This guide will give you an overview of the contribution workflow, from opening an issue, creating a PR, reviewing, and merging the PR.

## Steps for creating good issues.
  1. When you encounter an issue while developing, push the branch. (so that people can see what exactly you're working on)
  2. Create a pull request describing what you're doing with this branch, and set the PR there. (so that people can quickly grab the idea of your work)
  3. Then, create an issue that links back to the PR, and describe the challenge you're facing now.
  4. Assign the person who can solve the issue with you. (If you don't know who to assign to, go to our discord and share the issue)

## About the pull requests. 
  1. Please name the pull request with the status, the category, and the unit. E.g. [WIP] feat/post-smart-contract
  2. Once the PR is done, you can ask for a review. The PR can be merged after approval by **at least one other team member**.
