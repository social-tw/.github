## Hi there 👋 we are Unirep Social TW
Unirep Social TW applies UniRep Protocol and provides you with completely anonymous social media. All content on the platform will be on-chain. You can post, comment, and vote with randomized identity so that your actions cannot be tracked. We also have a reputation system to avoid malicious behavior on the platform. We aim to protect your identity privacy and allow you to enjoy the equality of sharing your interesting thoughts safely! 

## What is UniRep Protocol? 
UniRep is a private and non-repudiable data system. Users can receive attestations from attesters and voluntarily prove facts about their data without revealing the data itself. Moreover, users cannot refuse to receive attestations from an attester.
